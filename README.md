Text Recognition Using EasyOCR

This project focuses on extracting and recognizing text from images using EasyOCR, a deep learning-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library that supports multiple languages and is easy to use.

Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how EasyOCR can be used for efficient and accurate text recognition in images. It can be applied to various real-world scenarios such as document scanning, signboard reading, and scene text detection.
